A visual synipsis of the [Multi AI Agent Systems with crewAI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/multi-ai-agent-systems-with-crewai/) course.

You can use it as a reference or a non-linear learning resource.
You can also clone it and modify to your needs[^externalize].

[^externalize]: Most of the elements use inline documentation in ``documentation`` property. 
If you decide to extend that documentation, it might be a good idea to externalize it to a file and reference it usiing ``doc-ref`` property.

For example, you can:

* Create diagram element processors and generate Pythong code from diagrams.
* Create a library or libraries of pre-configured diagram elements so you can visually design agentic systems.
